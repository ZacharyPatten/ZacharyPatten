# `dotnet` Console Games Tips And Tricks

The following are some tips and tricks for coding `dotnet` console game applications. All of the code examples are in C#. Many of these are questions I have been asked by people looking at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-console-games. Please give the repository a look if you are interested in making console games. :)

> _**Author Note:** I intend to update this when asked additional questions. The numbers per topic may change._

<strong>#1. Use the "externalTerminal" setting if using Visual Studio Code on Windows. </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> If you are new to `dotnet` or C# I would really recommend you use Visual Studio over Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio is more beginner friendly.
>
> If you are using Visual Studio Code, the default setting when launching a console application is for it to run in the `"integratedTerminal"` in Visual Studio Code. However, that terminal does not support many of the members of `System.Console`. For example, if you call `Console.Clear` it will throw a runtime exception, which is not a problem with your code, it is just something that Visual Studio Code does not support. So when you are launching console applications in Visual Studio Code on Windows you should use the `"console": "externalTerminal",` setting. This will launch your code in a console window outside of Visual Studio Code in the same way Visual Studio works by default. Then your code will run as expected when you call methods like `Console.Clear`. Here is additional documentation on the launch settings in Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launchjson-attributes
>
> I'm under the impression that the `"console": "externalTerminal",` setting only works on Windows. I don't have experience using Visual Studio Code on Linux or MAC yet, so this setting may not work on non-Windows systems.

<strong>#2. How do you type characters like <code>╠</code>, <code>█</code>, and <code>╩</code>? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> Characters like `╠`, `█`, and `╩` are unicode characters just like `a`, `b`, and `c`. You can type them using ALT codes, but the "Character Map" application is a useful application that comes with Windows. If you are on Windows just search for it in your start menu or apps search and you should find it. Here is a screenshot:

<strong>#3. How to avoid flickering? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> The `Console.Clear()` method is very useful. It will clear the entire screen and set the cursor in the top left position. However, this can lead to flickering if you use this in the loop of a console game. So instead of using `Console.Clear()` consider using `Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0)` so that you can write the next frame without clearing all the content and thus reducing flickering.
>
> Here is a code example that would cause flickering:
>
> ```cs
> using System;
>
> int counter = 0;
> Console.CursorVisible = false;
> while (true)
> {
>   Console.Clear();
>   Console.WriteLine(counter++ + "           ");
>   Console.Write("This will flicker.");
> }
> ```
>
> Here is a code example that will not cause flickering:

> ```cs
> using System;
>
> int counter = 0;
> Console.CursorVisible = false;
> Console.Clear();
> while (true)
> {
>   Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
>   Console.WriteLine(counter++ + "           ");
>   Console.Write("This will not flicker.");

<strong>#4. How to get user input in a game loop? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> > **NOTE:** I have seen people using multi-threading where they have their game rendering and input handling in seperate threads. While that is a potential approach, that is overly complicated and usually unnecessary. I would avoid multi-threading just to handle console input.
>
> `Console.ReadLine()` is often the first method that people learn for getting user input. However, when making console games, I find myself using `Console.KeyAvailable` and `Console.ReadKey(true)` more often. `Console.KeyAvailable` lets you know if there are keys available in the input stream so that your code doesn't need to pause until the user provides input. `Console.ReadKey(true)` lets you detect individual keypresses rather than having to wait until the user presses the [enter] key, and it doesn't render the input to the console thanks to the `intercept` parameter.
>
> Here is a code example that will get user input without rendering it or pausing your code:
>
> ```cs
> using System;
>
> int counter = 0;
> ConsoleKey? lastKeyPressed = null;
> Console.CursorVisible = false;
> Console.Clear();
> string padding = new(' ', 30);
> while (true)
> {
>   while (Console.KeyAvailable)
>   {
>     lastKeyPressed = Console.ReadKey(true).Key;
>   }
>   Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
>   Console.WriteLine(counter++);
>   Console.Write($"The last key you pressed was {lastKeyPressed?.ToString() ?? "(null)"}.{padding}");
> }
> ```

<strong>#6. Keep in mind that not every member in <code>System.Console</code> is cross platform. </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> If you are using .NET (as opposed to .NET Framework), then your code is cross platform. However, although .NET is cross platform, not every member in the Base Class Library (BCL) is cross platform. Some of the members of `System.Console` only work on the Windows operating system. You can check by looking at the documentation for each member. For example, here is the documentation for `Console.Beep` https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.beep and it is clearly documented that it only works on Windows. If you want to use Windows-only members in your code, but you still want your code to be cross platform, all you need to do is include an operating system check using `OperatingSystem.IsWindows()`.
>
> Here is an example of wrapping Windows-only code in an operating system check so the code will still be cross platform:

<strong>#7. How to handle resizing of the console? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> The user may resize the console window to such a small size that your app can’t render properly anymore. Handling window resizing can be a bit annoying, and you may want to do something different in each game. For example, you may just want to close the game if the window is resized, or you way want to give the user the ability to increase the size of the window to keep playing. You will have to come up with a solution that works for you, but I will share one potential example that may help.

<strong>#9. How to hide the scroll bar on Windows? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>

> The reason a scroll bars may appear is when the `Console.BufferHeight` does not match the `Console.WindowHeight` or the `Console.BufferWidth` does not match the `Console.WindowWidth`. So an easy way to fix this on Windows is just to set them equal to each other, and the scroll bars should disappear.

> How can you do this? In general, the advice I would give is for you to make a "model" that can represent your game's state. You can then make a method that will render that model to the current `Console` view. That way all you need to do is update your model and call your render method.

> You "model" does not need to be a `char[,]` and you may need more than one variable. The best approach to model your game state will be different for every game. For Tic-Tac-Toe a `char[,]` may work pretty well, but for a text-based RPG, you likely need more variables to manage your game's state than just a `char[,]`. If you look through the games in the `dotnet-console-games` repository, you will see that all the games use different variables and types to model their states. Try to find the most elegant solution that will work for your game.

<strong>#11. How to target a framerate? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> Console ouput can be fairly slow from my experience, at least in Windows. So if you want to get a ~30 second framerate, it may require a bit more than just `Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1d/30d));`. For example, rendering your game could take `0.02 seconds` and if you sleep for `0.033... seconds` then your actual framerate is closer to `0.0.02 + 0.0333... = 0.0533... seconds`. So you need to factor in the time it takes to render your game into the time span you are sleeping/delaying.
>
> Here is the example from earlier in this article but updated with code to target roughly 30 frames per second (although it tends to be a bit slower than 30fps from my testing):
>
> ```cs
> using System;
> using System.Diagnostics;
> using System.Threading;
> 
> Stopwatch stopwatch = new();
> int counter = 0;
> Console.CursorVisible = false;
> Console.Clear();
> while (true)
> {
>   Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
>   Console.WriteLine(counter++ + "           ");
>   Console.Write("This will not flicker.");
>   SleepAfterRender();
> }
> 
> void SleepAfterRender()
> {
>   TimeSpan sleep = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1d/30d) - stopwatch.Elapsed;
>   if (sleep > TimeSpan.Zero)
>   {
>     Thread.Sleep(sleep);
>   }
>   stopwatch.Restart();
> }
> ```
>
> Calling `SleepAfterRender` will stabilize the framerate. Without calling `SleepAfterRender` the code would update as fast as it can. A use case for this could be if you have animations that you want to run at specific framerates. Also, this is more helpful when dealing with large console windows such as maximized full screen windows that take longer to output to the console.

<strong>#12. How to optimize console output? </strong><sub>[Expand]</sub>
</summary>
<p>

> There is a bit of baggage to this question, and each scenario may have a slightly different reason as to why the code may be inefficient. However, one general topic when dealing with console output is to reduce the number of times you invoke the `Console.Write` method. For example, what if you have code like this:
>
> ```cs
> using System;
> using System.Globalization;
>
> while (true)
> {
>     int width = Console.WindowWidth;
>     int height = Console.WindowHeight;
>     Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
>     for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
>     {
>         for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)
>         {
>             int randomDigit = Random.Shared.Next(10);
>             char c = randomDigit.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)[0];
>             Console.Write(c);
>         }
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> When I have even a medium size console window on Windows that can start to get noticably sluggish. Now, how can we reduce the number of `Console.Write` invocations? There are multiple ways, but one way is to use a `StringBuilder` to build the current view, and then have a single `Console.Write` after the nested loops. Here is what that could look like:
>
> ```cs
> using System;
> using System.Globalization;
> using System.Text;
>
> while (true)
> {
>     int width = Console.WindowWidth;
>     int height = Console.WindowHeight;
>     StringBuilder stringBuilder = new();
>     for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
>     {
>         for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)
>         {
>             int randomDigit = Random.Shared.Next(10);
>             char c = randomDigit.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)[0];
>             stringBuilder.Append(c);
>         }
>     }
>     Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
>     Console.Write(stringBuilder);
> }
> ```
>
> The above example should run noticably faster than the first example. This only covers one potential optimization. There are many other topics to consider. But this is probably the biggest bang for your buck if your console game is running a bit sluggish.

> If you check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-console-games), you will notice that many of the games are playable online in your browser. How does that work? This is more complex than the other topics in this list, but here is a brief overview:
>
> I ported the code for each console game to blazor webassembly, which is a separate project type than console applications, and the path for that project is `Projects/Website`. I wrote a [`BlazorConsole`](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-console-games/blob/main/Projects/Website/BlazorConsole.cs) class which contains mostly identical members to the `Syste.Console` class, and when I port the console code to blazor I use a `public readonly BlazorConsole Console = new();` field to direct code to my `BlazorConsole` rather than `System.Console`, however, many of the members of `BlazorConsole` are `async` and thus require the `await` keyword be added to the relative methods in the ported code.
